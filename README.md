# magicalitems
This magical items game should allow the user to click on an image of a magical item to accrue points, until the player either matches the target number or the player exceeds the target number. If the player is able to match the target number, then the player wins the game and that will reflect in the number of wins.

Each magical item has a predetermined random number value assigned to it at the beginning of each game. The player must click on the magical icon images to determine how much each item will increment.
